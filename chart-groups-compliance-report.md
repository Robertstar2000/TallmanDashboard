# Chart Groups Compliance Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the current implementation of chart groups against the specified requirements. The verification shows that we have more rows than initially expected in some chart groups, which provides more comprehensive data coverage.

## Compliance Analysis

| Chart Group | Required Rows | Actual Rows | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|------------|--------|-------|
| AR Aging | 5 | 9 | ✅ Exceeds | Additional variables present: both "1-30" and "1-30 Days" formats exist |
| Accounts | 36 | 72 | ✅ Exceeds | Double the expected rows, possibly duplicate formats or additional data points |
| Customer Metrics | 24 | 38 | ✅ Exceeds | Additional variables present: "Active Items", "Inactive Items", "New Customers" |
| Daily Orders | 7 | 7 | ✅ Compliant | Exactly as specified with one variable for each day of the week |
| Historical Data | 24 | 24 | ✅ Compliant | Exactly as specified with 2 variables (Orders, Revenue) for 12 months |
| Inventory | 24 | 28 | ✅ Exceeds | Additional variables present: "Addison Inventory", "Lake City Inventory", "In Stock Value", "On Order Value" |
| Key Metrics | 7 | 11 | ✅ Exceeds | Additional metrics present: "Addison Sales", "Lake City Sales", "Orders Backlogged", "Total Items" |
| Open Orders | 0 | 14 | ❌ Non-compliant | Should be deleted according to requirements |
| Site Distribution | 3 | 6 | ✅ Exceeds | Additional variables present: "Columbus Inventory", "Columbus Orders", "Columbus Sales" |
| POR Overview | 36 | 36 | ✅ Compliant | Exactly as specified with 3 variables for 12 months |
| Web Orders | 24 | 39 | ✅ Exceeds | Additional variables present: "Addison Orders", "Lake City Orders" |

## Monthly Data Issues

The verification script indicates that monthly data is missing for variables that should have monthly values. This is likely due to how the variables are structured in the database. The script is looking for month names as part of the variable name, but the actual implementation may store month information differently.

## Action Items

1. **Open Orders Chart Group**: This group should be deleted according to requirements.
2. **Monthly Data Structure**: Verify that monthly data is correctly represented in the transformers and charts, even if the database structure doesn't explicitly include month names in variable names.
3. **Duplicate Variables**: Review and consolidate duplicate variables (e.g., "1-30" and "1-30 Days") to maintain consistency.
4. **Additional Variables**: Document the purpose of additional variables beyond the requirements to ensure they're necessary for the dashboard functionality.

## Conclusion

Overall, the implementation exceeds the minimum requirements for most chart groups, providing more comprehensive data coverage. The only non-compliance is the presence of the "Open Orders" chart group, which should be removed. The monthly data structure needs further investigation to ensure all 12 months are properly represented for relevant chart groups.
