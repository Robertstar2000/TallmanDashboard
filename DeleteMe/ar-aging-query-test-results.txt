Generating improved queries for AR Aging:

Working on bucket: Current

Testing query for "Current" against test database:
SQL: SELECT 0 /* Default SQL for AR Aging - Amount Due */
Result: {"0 /* Default SQL for AR Aging - Amount Due */":0}
Non-zero result: NO

Testing query for "Current" against test database:
SQL: 
          SELECT SUM(open_amount) as value
